You will firstly want to change the pathways of the text files in classes CRScanner line 26 and TicketGenerator line 16
Additionally, you will want to either remove the package Assignement2SDAAGroup17; located at the top of each file and run it in the SRC

Or create a package called Assignement2SDAAGroup17 and store all the files in the code folder there

Once that has been adjusted you want to run the program from the CashRegisterDriverApp

From there the GUI will display and then you want to enter the UPCCode in the text field located at the top of the GUI

The current UPC codes are 1001, 1002, 1004 and press the button next to the text field

these will display the product information assocaited with them in the GUI

any other upc code will display Unknown product

after you have entered all the products you will then press the proceed to checkout button on the bottom and then choose whichever payment option necessary

after this the GUI will close and the receipt will be printed in the text file Receipt.txt
